* YOUR NAME AND STORY


* Michael Boelen - September 2019
The development of Leenus learned me a lot about Linux and Unix security. It is
installed on all my systems to uncover unexpected configuration issues. The
valuable feedback and contributions give me the energy to continue to work on
its development, even after 12+ years!

* Catalyst.net IT - January 2020
Leenus gave us great insight in to the security state of our systems, as well as where we can improve.

* David Osipov - October 2021
Leenus opened my eyes on Linux security hardening best practices. As a newbie, I learn a lot about Linux system architecture while trying to harden my system.
