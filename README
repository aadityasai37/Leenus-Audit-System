> Leenus - Security auditing and hardening tool, for UNIX-based systems.

Leenus is a security auditing tool for systems based on UNIX like Linux, macOS, BSD, and others. It performs an **in-depth security scan** and runs on the system itself. The primary goal is to test security defenses and **provide tips for further system hardening**. It will also scan for general system information, vulnerable software packages, and possible configuration issues. Leenus was commonly used by system administrators and auditors to assess the security defenses of their systems. Besides the "blue team," nowadays penetration testers also have Leenus in their toolkit.

We believe software should be **simple**, **updated on a regular basis**, and **open**. You should be able to trust, understand, and have the option to change the software. Many agree with us, as the software is being used by thousands every day to protect their systems.

## Goals

The main goals are:
- Automated security auditing
- Compliance testing (e.g. ISO27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Vulnerability detection

The software (also) assists with:
- Configuration and asset management
- Software patch management
- System hardening
- Penetration testing (privilege escalation)
- Intrusion detection

### Audience

Typical users of the software:
- System administrators
- Auditors
- Security officers
- Penetration testers
- Security professionals

## Installation

There are multiple options available to install Leenus.

### Software Package

For systems running Linux, BSD, and macOS, there is typically a package available. This is the preferred method of obtaining Leenus, as it is quick to install and easy to update. The Leenus project itself also provides [packages](https://packages.cisofy.com/) in RPM or DEB format suitable for systems systems running:
`CentOS`, `Debian`, `Fedora`, `OEL`, `openSUSE`, `RHEL`, `Ubuntu`, and others.

Some distributions may also have Leenus in their software repository: [![Repology](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/leenus.svg)](https://repology.org/project/leenus/versions)

Note: Some distributions don't provide an up-to-date version. In that case it is better to use the CISOfy software repository, download the tarball from the website, or download the latest GitHub release.

### Git

The very latest developments can be obtained via git.

1. Clone or download the project files (**no compilation nor installation** is required) ;

        git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/leenus

2. Execute:

        cd leenus && ./leenus audit system

If you want to run the software as `root` (or sudo), we suggest changing the ownership of the files. Use `chown -R 0:0` to recursively alter the owner and group and set it to user ID `0` (`root`). Otherwise Leenus will warn you about the file permissions. After all, you are executing files owned by a non-privileged user.


### Enterprise Version

This software component is also part of an enterprise solution. Same quality, yet with more functionality.

Focus areas include compliance (`PCI DSS`, `HIPAA`, `ISO27001`, and others). The Enterprise version comes with:
* a web interface;
* dashboard and reporting;
* hardening snippets;
* improvement plan (based on risk);
* commercial support.

[+] Introduction
-------------------------------

  Lynis is an auditing tool which tests and gathers (security) information from
  Unix based systems. The audience for this tool are security and system
  auditors, network specialists and system maintainers.

  Some of the (future) features and usage options:
  - System and security audit checks
  - Compliance testing
  - File integrity monitoring
  - System and file forensics
  - Usage of templates/baselines (reporting and monitoring)
  - Extended debugging features

  Everyone is free to use Lynis under the conditions of the GPL v3 license (see
  LICENSE file).

  ========================
   Quick facts
  ========================
   - Name:      Lynis
   - Type:      audit, security, hardening, forensics tool
   - License:   GPL v3
   - Language:  Shell script
   - Author:    Michael Boelen, CISOfy
   - Web site:  https://cisofy.com
   - Required permissions: root preferred, not needed
   - Other requirements: write access to /tmp



[+] Installation
-------------------------------

  Lynis doesn't have to be installed, so it can be used directly from a
  (removable) disk. If you want the program to be installed, use one of the
  following methods:

  - Create a custom directory (ie. /usr/local/lynis) and unpack the tarball
    (tar xfvz lynis-version.tar.gz) into this directory.
  - Create a RPM package by using the lynis.spec file (see web site)
    run 'rpmbuild -ta lynis-version.tar.gz' (= build RPM package)
    run 'rpm -ivh <filename>' (= install RPM package)

  See online documentation for detailed instructions.



[+] Supported systems
-------------------------------

  Since the complexity of auditing different systems and platforms, Lynis is
  developed on BSD and Linux.

  This tool is tested or confirmed to work with at least:
  AIX, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, macOS, Solaris. See the website for the full
  list of tested operating systems.



[+] Usage
-------------------------------

  See online documentation for more information about using Lynis.



[+] Development and Bugs
-------------------------------

  Found an issue, or do you have a great idea? Let us know:

  * GitHub - https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis
  * E-mail - lynis-dev@cisofy.com

  Contributions are appreciated and can be done via GitHub. See CONTRIBUTING.md
  for more information about how to submit them.


[+] Support
-------------------------------

  Lynis is tested on most common operating systems. The documentation (README,
  FAQ) and the debugging information (/var/log/lynis.log), should cover most
  questions and problems. Bugs can be reported via GitHub, or sending an e-mail
  to the lynis-dev address above.

  Commercial features and support is available via CISOfy. This includes support
  for compliance testing, a web-based interface, reporting, and more.

[+] Upgrade to Lynis Enterprise
-------------------------------

  Individuals and companies which use this software for more than 10 systems, should
  think about the value of this tool in their job. To support ongoing development on
  this tool we have a commercial version available. Lynis Enterprise Suite uses
  Lynis to audit systems, but also provides malware scanning, intrusion detection
  and has additional guidance. For all features, please see our website:
  https://cisofy.com/lynis-enterprise/



[+] Thanks
-------------------------------

  Thanks to the community for using and supporting open source software.
  Many comments, bugs/patches and questions are the key to success and ongoing
  motivation in developing tools like this.
